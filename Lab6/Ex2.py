#Write Python code that creates a list with a variety of different values. 
# Include control logic (if, elif, else) that will print different messages whether the list 
# contains fewer than 5 elements, between 5 and 10 (inclusive), and more than 10 elements. 
# Test your code on lists with several different lengths.
